    "ðŸ¤— Transformers provides a Trainer class to help you fine-tune any of the pretrained models it provides on your dataset. Once you've done all the data preprocessing work onin the last section, you have just a few steps left to define the Trainer. The hardest part is likely to be preparing the environment to run Trainer.train(), as it will run very slowly on a CPU. If you don't a GPU set up, you can get access to free GPUs or TPUs on Google Colab.\n",

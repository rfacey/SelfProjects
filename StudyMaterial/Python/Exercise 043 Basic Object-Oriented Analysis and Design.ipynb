    "# Basic Object-Oriented Analysis and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to describe a process to use when you want to build something using Python, specifically with object-oriented programming (OOP), What I mean by a \"process\" is that I'll give you a set of steps that you do in order but that you aren't meant to be a slave to or that will totally always work for every problem. They are just a good starting point for many programming problems and shouldn't be considered the only way to solve these types of problems. This process is just one way to do it that you can follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write or draw about the problem.\n",
    "2. Extract key concepts from 1 and research them.\n",
    "3. Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts.\n",
    "4. Code the classes and test to run them.\n",
    "5. Repeat and refine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to look atn this process is that it is \"top down,\" meaning it starts from the very abstract loose idea and then slowly refines it until the idea is solid and something you can code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I start by just writing about a problem and trying to think up anything I can about it. Maybe I'll even draw a diagram or two, maybe a map of some kind, or even write myself a series of emails describing the problem. This gives me a way to express the key concepts in the problem and also explore what I might already know about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I go through these notes, drawing and descriptions, and I pull out the key concepts. There's a simple trick to doing this: Simply make a list of all the nouns and verbs in your writing and drawings, then write out how they're related. This gives me a good list of names for classes, objects, and functions in the next step. I take this list of concepts and then research any that I don't understsand so I can refine them further if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I have my list of concepts I create a simple outline/tree of the concepts and how they are related as classes. You can usually take your list of nouns and start asking \"Is this one like other concept nouns? That means they have a common parent class, so what is it called?\" Keep doing this until you have a class hierarchy that's just a simple tree list or a diagram. Then take the verbs you ahve and see if those are function names for each class and put them in your tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this class hierarchy figured out, I sit down and write some basic skeleton code that has just the classes, their functions, and nothing more. I then write a test that runs this code and makes sure the classes I've made make sense and work right. Sometimes I may write the test first though, and other times I might write a little test, a little code, a little test, etc. until I have the whole thing built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I keep cycling over this process repating it and refining it as I go and making it as clear as I can before doing more implementation. If I get stuck at any particular part because of a concept or problem I haven't anticipated, then I sit down and start the process over on just that part to figure it out more before continuing.\n",
    "I will no go through this process while coming up with a game engine and a game for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Analysis of a Simple Game Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "The game I want to make is called \"Gothons from Planet Parcal #25,\" and it will be a small space adventure game. With nothing more than that concept in my mind, I can explore the idea and figure out how to make the game come to life.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write or Draw About the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to write a little paragraph for the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Aliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze of rooms defeating them so he can excape into an escape pod to the planet below. The game will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways to die. The game will involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print its own description when the player enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out of the map.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point I have a good idea for the same and how it would run, so now I want to describe each scene:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Death** This is when the player dies and should be something funny.\n",
    "**Central Corridor** This is the starting point and has a Gothon already standing there that the players have to defeat with a joke before continuing.\n",
    "**Laser Weapon Armory** This is where the hero gets a neutron bomb to blow up the ship before getting to the escape pod. It has a keypad the hero has to guess the number for.\n",
    "**The Bridge** Another battle scene with a Gothon where the hero places the bomb.\n",
    "**Escape Pod** Where the hero escape buit only after guessing the right escape pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point I might draw out a map of these, maybe write more descriptions of each room - whatever comes to mind as I explore the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extract Key Concepts and Research Them\n",
    "\n",
    "I now have enough information to extract some of the nouns and analyze their class hierarchy. First I make a list of all the nouns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alien\n",
    "- Player\n",
    "- Ship\n",
    "- Maze\n",
    "- Room\n",
    "- Scene\n",
    "- Gothon\n",
    "- Escape Pod\n",
    "- Planet\n",
    "- Map\n",
    "- Engine\n",
    "- Death\n",
    "- Central Corridor\n",
    "- Laser Weapon Armory\n",
    "- The Bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also possibly go through all the verbs and see if they are anything that might be good function names, but I'll skip that for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you might also research each of these concepts and anything you don't know right now. For example, I might play a few of these types of games and make sure I know how they work. I might research how ships are designed or how bombs work. Maybe I'll research some technical issue like how to store the game's state in a database. After I've done this research I might start over at step 1 based on new information I have and rewrite my description and extract new concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Class Hierarchy and Object Map for the Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I have that I turn it into a class hierarchy by asking \"What is similar to other things?\" I also ask \"What is basically just another word for another thing?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Right away I se that \"Room\" and \"Scene\" are basically the same thing depending on how I want to do things. I'm going to pick \"Scene\" for this game. Then I see that all the specific rooms like \"Central Corridor\" are basically just Scenes. I see also that Death is basically a Scene, which confirms my choice of \"Scene\" over \"Room\" since you can have a death scene, but a death room is kind of odd. \"Maze\" and \"Map\" are basically the same so I'm going to go with \"Map\" since I used it more often. I don't want to do a battle system, so I'm going to ignore \"Alien\" and \"Player\" and save that for later. The \"Planet\" could also just be another scene instead of something specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all of that thought process I start to make a class hierarchy that looks like this in my text editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map\n",
    "- Engine\n",
    "- Scene\n",
    "    - Death\n",
    "    - Central Corridor\n",
    "    - The Laser Weapon Armory\n",
    "    - The Bridge\n",
    "    - Escape Pod\n",
    "    \n",
    "I would then go through and figure out what actions are needed on each thing based on verbs in the description. For example, I know from the description I'm going to need a way to \"run\" the engine, \"get the next scene\" from the map, get the \"opening scene,\" and \"enter\" a scene. I'll add those like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map\n",
    "    - next_scene\n",
    "    - opening_scene\n",
    "- Engine\n",
    "    - play\n",

    "    - Laser Weapon Armory\n",
    "    - The Bridge\n",
    "    - Escape Pod\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice how I put - enter under Scene since I know that all the scenes under it will inherit it and have to override it later.\n",

Usually I'll just copy-paste the tree into the source file and then edit it into classes. Here's a small example of how this might look at first, with a simple little test at the end of the file."

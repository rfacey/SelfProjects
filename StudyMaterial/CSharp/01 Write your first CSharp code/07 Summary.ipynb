    "Your goal was to write code that displayed simple messages to an output console while familiarizing yourself with the syntax. You wrote your first lines of code using basic C# syntax. You learned two techniques for displaying literal-string data to the console. YOu also learned what to look for when you come across an error in your code. And lastly, you identified C# syntax elements like classes sna dmethods, and the puurpose of several special symbols that are known as operators. You've taken your first steps towards building more sophisticated applications."

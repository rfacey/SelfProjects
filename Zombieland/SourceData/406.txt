Mountain Dew?

He was homeless and sick...

And i was walking home from the bar
talking on the phone.

And then, he just came, sprinting towards me.

I mean, not, not running,
'sprinting'.

And I thought you know he was, like maybe
he was running from someone

or after someone... the last time I saw
he was out there going crazy.

No

I didn't even told you the worst part.

He tried to bite me.

Sorry, I was just so scared.

Really?
  
Do you mind if I just
close my eyes for a minute?

Thank you.

Goodnight.

No one back there but
my duffel bag.

from getting too familiar.

No.

Where are you headed?

Tallahassee.

More?

So?

Here's the deal, Columbus...uh
Im not easy to get along with

and I'm sensing you're a bit of a bitch

So I'll give this relationship to about uh, Texarkana.

You're a pappy little spit fuck
aren't you?

I can tell already, you are getting on my nerves

Business is good.

Well, take a look. It's a goddamn 'Hostess' truck.

I could use a Twinkie.

You coming?

Are you fucking with me?

I don't believe in it. You ever seen a
lion limber up before it takes down a gazelle?

Sno-balls..?

Sno-balls?

Where's the fucking Twinkies?

I hate coconut.
Not the taste, the consistency.

Oh, this Twinkie thing

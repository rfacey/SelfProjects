Come quick.

Yeah, I know.
I know, and she knows

We're just looking for a way out.

Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

I'll do it.

I love you.

Now that you mention it.

We'll take your weapons, your car keys,
your ammunition.

Well, better you make the mistake of trusting us,
than us make the mistake of trusting you.

Do not say the S-H-O-W-E-R, okay?

Let's just get where we're going.

Is what true?

Trust me.

Bummer.

Now, step away from the vehicle.

You get to ride shotgun.

My engagement ring.

I-I took it off to pump my gas,
and I thought that I put it in my purse,
but it must have fallen out,
and I'm late for my flight and--

I'll give you a reward.

Three thousand dollars.
It's worth more than my car.

Nice.

How many left?

Hm. For the low price of thirty bucks, sold.

Really?

Okay. How about we play
the quiet game?
Yeah? Starting now.

You never played the quiet game?

No? Well, they're playing
it in Columbus, Ohio.
It's a total ghost town.
It's burned to the ground.

You're Columbus.

I'm sorry.

I didn't realize it was...

Uh.
We can, uh,
get you a ride.

You know, you can
go see for yourself,
or settle somewhere new.

I know this Pacific Playland
thing is nuts,
but it's just been so long
since she got to be a kid.

It's tough growing up.

There.
You can take that truck.

Well, I, uh, hope you find
whoever it is you're
looking for.
And don't let go, once you do.

Okay, but what the hell are we doing?

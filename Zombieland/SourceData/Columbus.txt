"Oh, America"

  
I wish i could tell you that
this was still America.

  
But I've come to realise that
you can't have a country without people.

  
And there are no people here

  
No my friends... this is now
"The United States Of Zombieland"

  
It's amazing how quickly thing can go from
'bad' to 'total shit-storm'.

  
And why am I alive,
when everyone around me had turned to meat?

  
It's because of my list of rules.

  
Rule number one for survival in Zombieland...
is "Cardio".

When the virus struck, for obvious reasons,
the first one to go were the fatties.

  
Poor fat bastard!

  
As the infection spread
and chaos grew...

  
It wasn't enough
just being fast on your feet

  
You'd have to get a gun
and learn how to use it.

  
Which leads me to my second rule
"The Double Tap"

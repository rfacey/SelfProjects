"Oh, America"

  
I wish i could tell you that
this was still America.

  
But I've come to realise that
you can't have a country without people.

  
And there are no people here

  
No my friends... this is now
"The United States Of Zombieland"

  
It's amazing how quickly thing can go from
'bad' to 'total shit-storm'.

  
And why am I alive,
when everyone around me had turned to meat?

  
It's because of my list of rules.

  
Rule number one for survival in Zombieland...
is "Cardio".

When the virus struck, for obvious reasons,
the first one to go were the fatties.

  
Poor fat bastard!

  
As the infection spread
and chaos grew...

  
It wasn't enough
just being fast on your feet

  
You'd have to get a gun
and learn how to use it.

  
Which leads me to my second rule
"The Double Tap"

In those moments when you're not sure
that the 'undead' are really dead-dead

  
Don't get off stingy with your bullets.
I mean one more clean shot to the head.

  
And this lady could have avoided
becoming a human happy-meal.

  
Woulda? Coulda?
Shoulda?

It wasn't long before
the zombies began to get clever.

  
When you are at your most vulnerable,
somehow they could just smell it.

  
Don't let them catch you
with your pants down.

  
Rule number three "Beware of Bathrooms"

As zombie began to outnumber humans

  
That's when you have
to cut all emotional ties

  
If the girls in your neigborhood are now
fucked up little monsters,

  
Oh, maybe it's time to stop
driving car pools.

You have to focus, on your own survival,
which leads to Rule number four

  
Pretty basic.

  
"Fasten your seatbelts"

It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

That guy down there, is me.

I'm in Garland, Texas. That may look like
zombies destroyed it, but that's actually Garland.

  
It's been two months since patient zero took a bite out
of a contaminated burger at a Gas-And-Gulp 
Just two months, and I might be
the last non-cannibal freak in the country.

I may seem like an unlikely survivor
with all my phobias and irritable bowel syndrome.

but I had the advantage of never having
any friends or close family.

I survive because
I played it safe and follow the rules...

My rules.

Shit.

Of course.

Motherfucker.

On the bright side,
I did find the place to go number two

Another rule to surviving Zombieland:
'Travel light'

And I don't mean just luggage.

I've always been kind of a loner, I avoided other people
like they were zombies; even before they were zombies.

  
Now that they are all zombies,
I kinda miss people.

So I'm on my way from my college dorm
in Austin, Texas to Columbus, Ohio.

Where, Im hoping my parents
are still alive.

  
Eventhough, we were never really close,
just be nice to see a familiar face.

Or any face that doesn't have blood dripping
from it's lips and flesh between its teeth.

Thank you.

Nothing, I just uh...

  
I have this list.

What's your name?

You almost knocked off
your alcohol with your knife.

That's okay, you don't have to...

Columbus.

You?

Uh, no, one for me, one and done.
I always say. I said that once.

You know, Tallahassee and
Columbus are, both uh...east.

So, Tallahassee,
you wanna stick together? At least for a while

Really? Yeah. You'll take me as far as Texarkana.

You  might wanna buckle up, you know for safety.

Even though teaming up
wasn't my style.

I figured, I'll be safer
with Tallahassee.

You see he was in the ass kicking business, and...

It became quickly apparent however that
he did have one weaknesss.

What are we doing here?

Yeah, I see that
a Hostess truck. So what?

Uh yes, yeah, one second

No.

You should actually, limber up as well especially,
if you're going down that hill its very important.

Yeah

I like Sno-balls.

Fresh

This may be a bad time, but,
I gotta take the Browns to the Super Bowl.

Really.

I know. Again?
So soon? What can I say.

I have a case of cronic anxiety.

Truth is.. I was always kind of phobic

I found lots of things disturbing

Like undertoe, or department store santas,
being alone with a baby.

But the thing I fear more than anything,
yes, even more than zombies.

Fucking clowns.

When you're afraid of everything that's out there,
You quit going out there.

Which is what happened to me
before Zombieland.

Friday night.
Third straight week indoors.

  
World of Warcraft.

Leaning tower of pizza boxes.
Code red Mountain Dew.

  
Pride?
No where.

Dignity?
Long gone.

Virginity?
Totally justifiable to speculate on.

My whole life,
All I ever wanted was to find a girl.

  
And fall in love,
bring her home to meet the folks.

Then again, since my folks are a couple
of paranoid shut ins like me

Maybe this girl could bring me
home to her folks.

  
And then, I'll finally be a member of
a cool functional family.

I don't usually unlock my door
to the sounds of panic,

...but my neighbour is 406 insanely hot.

Okay, okay

Nice to meet you.

Here
There you go

Yeah, Code Red.

And here's some Gold Grams.

  
The zip lock bags keep them crisp.

Okay.
Keep that there

So tell me, what happened?

Drugs, maybe?

Yeah?

You are right, that's the worst part.

No no no, you should be scared
the homeless guys just tried to eat you.

That's like the right kind of scare,
that's a reasonable scare.

  
You know, I get scared for things
that don't make sense at all, like...

  
Clowns, with red noses, or like
the rag that use to wipe on table.

when you finishes eating,
like a.. chain restaurant.

Look, the point is I'm here for you, okay?

  
And as long as you're by my side,
I'm not leaving this apartment.

No, of course, of course.

Set aside the feverish homeless cannibal
I'm living in the dream.

I've had always my whole life
wanted to brush a girl's hair over her ear.

Goodnight

Oh my god.

Are you okay?

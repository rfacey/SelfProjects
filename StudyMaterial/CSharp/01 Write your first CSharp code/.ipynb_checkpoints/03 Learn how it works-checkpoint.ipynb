    "# Learn how it works\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how your code works, you need to step back and think about what a programming language is. Consider how your code communicates commmands to the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages like C# let you write instructions that you want the computer to carry out. Each programming language has its own syntax,but after learning your first programming language and attempting to learn another one, you'll quickly realize that they all share many similar concepts. A programming language's job is to allow a human to express their intent in a human-readable and understandable way. The instructions you write in a programming language are called \"source code\" or just \"code\". Software developers write code.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, a developer can update and change the code, but the computer can't understand the code. The code first must be *compiled* into a format that the computer can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is compilation?\n",
    "\n",
    "A special program called a **compiler** converts your source code into a different format that the computer's central processing unit (CPU) can execute. When you ran the previous unit, the code you wrote was first compiled, then executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does code need to be compiled? Although most programming languages seem cryptic at first, they can be more easily understood by humans that the computer's *preferred* language. The CPU understands instructions that are expressed by turning thousands or millions of tiny switches either on or off. Compilers bridge these two worlds by translating your human-readable instructions into a computer-understandable set of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is syntax?\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules for writing C# code is called syntax. Just like human languages have rules regarding punctuation and sentence structure, computer programming languages also have rules. Those rules define the keywords and operators of C# and how they are put togetther to form programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you wrote code into the .NET Editor, you may have noticed subtle changes to the color of different words and symbols. Syntax highlighting is a helpful feature that you'll begin to use to easily spot mistakes in your code that don't conform to the syntax rules of C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How did your code work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's focus on the following line of code you wrote:"

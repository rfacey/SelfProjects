Earlier, you were shown that you could use Matplotlib to graph on top of your images, but Matplotlib isn't really meant for this purpose, especially not with video feeds. Luckily, OpenCV comes with some great tools to help us draw and mark up our feeds in real time, which is what we'll be discussing in the next tutorial."

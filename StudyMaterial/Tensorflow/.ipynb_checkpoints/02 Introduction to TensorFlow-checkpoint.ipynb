    "\"A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional array of base dataypes.\" (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensor)\n",

    "It shouldn;t surprise you that tensors are a fundamental aspect of TensorFlow. They are the main objects that are passed around and manipulated throughout the program. Each tensor presents a partially defined computation that will eventually produce a value. TensorFlow programs work by building a graph of Tensor objects that details how tensors are related. Running different parts of the graph allow results to be generated.\n",

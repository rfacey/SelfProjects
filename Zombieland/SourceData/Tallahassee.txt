What are you looking for?

No one back there but
my duffel bag.

Stop, no names. Keeps us
from getting too familiar.

No.

Where are you headed?

Tallahassee.

More?

So?

Here's the deal, Columbus...uh
Im not easy to get along with

and I'm sensing you're a bit of a bitch

So I'll give this relationship to about uh, Texarkana.

You're a pappy little spit fuck
aren't you?

I can tell already, you are getting on my nerves

Business is good.

Well, take a look. It's a goddamn 'Hostess' truck.

I could use a Twinkie.

You coming?

Are you fucking with me?

I don't believe in it. You ever seen a
lion limber up before it takes down a gazelle?

Sno-balls..?

Sno-balls?

Where's the fucking Twinkies?

I hate coconut.
Not the taste, the consistency.

Oh, this Twinkie thing
it ain't over yet.

Really?

Alright, you steer, I'll push.

Back east, yeah.

Out west we hear, back east..back east
they hear it's here out west.

It's all just nonsense.

You know, you're like a penguin on the north pole,
hear the south pole is really nice this time of year.

You wanna feel how hard
I can punch?

So, what do you think?

Last time you went 20 toes,
put Percy in the playpen?

Went heels to Jesus.

Well, just sex.

Shut up.

What was her name?

You dog.

Me?

I... I... Aye, aye, aye

Hungry.

Look, whatever you have waiting for
you in Columbus, I promise you

It ain't be any pretty than our
friend here enjoying her man-which.

There's a boxes of Twinkies
in that grocery store.

  
Not just any box of Twinkie.

The last box of Twinkie that anyone
will enjoy in the whole universe.

Believe it or not,
Twinkies have an expiration day.

Someday very soon, life's little
Twinkle gauge is gonna go empty.

Time to nut up or shut up!

You got a pretty mouth!

You owe me.

I know

Twinkie, Twinkie,
Twinkie, Twinkie.

Oh, big hoss.

Come here big fella,
just gonna take a little off the top.

Wow, these fellas really let themselves go.

They're sisters. The little one's been bitten.
Act normal, try not to freak her out.

Colombus.
Wichita, Little Rock.

You need some help?

What the fuck.

Nice going genius.

"Oh, America"

  
I wish i could tell you that
this was still America.

  
But I've come to realise that
you can't have a country without people.

  
And there are no people here

  
No my friends... this is now
"The United States Of Zombieland"

  
It's amazing how quickly thing can go from
'bad' to 'total shit-storm'.

  
And why am I alive,
when everyone around me had turned to meat?

  
It's because of my list of rules.

  
Rule number one for survival in Zombieland...
is "Cardio".

When the virus struck, for obvious reasons,
the first one to go were the fatties.

  
Poor fat bastard!

  
As the infection spread
and chaos grew...

  
It wasn't enough
just being fast on your feet

  
You'd have to get a gun
and learn how to use it.

  
Which leads me to my second rule
"The Double Tap"

In those moments when you're not sure
that the 'undead' are really dead-dead

  
Don't get off stingy with your bullets.
I mean one more clean shot to the head.

  
And this lady could have avoided
becoming a human happy-meal.

  
Woulda? Coulda?
Shoulda?

It wasn't long before
the zombies began to get clever.

  
When you are at your most vulnerable,
somehow they could just smell it.

  
Don't let them catch you
with your pants down.

  
Rule number three "Beware of Bathrooms"

As zombie began to outnumber humans

  
That's when you have
to cut all emotional ties

  
If the girls in your neigborhood are now
fucked up little monsters,

  
Oh, maybe it's time to stop
driving car pools.

You have to focus, on your own survival,
which leads to Rule number four

  
Pretty basic.

  
"Fasten your seatbelts"

It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

That guy down there, is me.

I'm in Garland, Texas. That may look like
zombies destroyed it, but that's actually Garland.

  
It's been two months since patient zero took a bite out
of a contaminated burger at a Gas-And-Gulp 
Just two months, and I might be
the last non-cannibal freak in the country.

I may seem like an unlikely survivor
with all my phobias and irritable bowel syndrome.

but I had the advantage of never having
any friends or close family.

I survive because
I played it safe and follow the rules...

My rules.

Shit.

Of course.

Motherfucker.

On the bright side,
I did find the place to go number two

Another rule to surviving Zombieland:
'Travel light'

And I don't mean just luggage.

I've always been kind of a loner, I avoided other people
like they were zombies; even before they were zombies.

  
Now that they are all zombies,
I kinda miss people.

So I'm on my way from my college dorm
in Austin, Texas to Columbus, Ohio.

Where, Im hoping my parents
are still alive.

  
Eventhough, we were never really close,
just be nice to see a familiar face.

Or any face that doesn't have blood dripping
from it's lips and flesh between its teeth.

Thank you.

Nothing, I just uh...

  
I have this list.

What's your name?

You almost knocked off
your alcohol with your knife.

That's okay, you don't have to...

Columbus.

You?

Uh, no, one for me, one and done.
I always say. I said that once.

You know, Tallahassee and
Columbus are, both uh...east.

So, Tallahassee,
you wanna stick together? At least for a while

Really? Yeah. You'll take me as far as Texarkana.

You  might wanna buckle up, you know for safety.

Even though teaming up
wasn't my style.

I figured, I'll be safer
with Tallahassee.

You see he was in the ass kicking business, and...

It became quickly apparent however that
he did have one weaknesss.

What are we doing here?

Yeah, I see that
a Hostess truck. So what?

Uh yes, yeah, one second

No.

You should actually, limber up as well especially,
if you're going down that hill its very important.

Yeah

I like Sno-balls.

Fresh

This may be a bad time, but,
I gotta take the Browns to the Super Bowl.

Really.

I know. Again?
So soon? What can I say.

I have a case of cronic anxiety.

Truth is.. I was always kind of phobic

I found lots of things disturbing

Like undertoe, or department store santas,
being alone with a baby.

But the thing I fear more than anything,
yes, even more than zombies.

Fucking clowns.

When you're afraid of everything that's out there,
You quit going out there.

Which is what happened to me
before Zombieland.

Friday night.
Third straight week indoors.

  
World of Warcraft.

Leaning tower of pizza boxes.
Code red Mountain Dew.

  
Pride?
No where.

Dignity?
Long gone.

Virginity?
Totally justifiable to speculate on.

My whole life,
All I ever wanted was to find a girl.

  
And fall in love,
bring her home to meet the folks.

Then again, since my folks are a couple
of paranoid shut ins like me

Maybe this girl could bring me
home to her folks.

  
And then, I'll finally be a member of
a cool functional family.

I don't usually unlock my door
to the sounds of panic,

...but my neighbour is 406 insanely hot.

Okay, okay

Nice to meet you.

Here
There you go

Yeah, Code Red.

And here's some Gold Grams.

  
The zip lock bags keep them crisp.

Okay.
Keep that there

So tell me, what happened?

Drugs, maybe?

Yeah?

You are right, that's the worst part.

No no no, you should be scared
the homeless guys just tried to eat you.

That's like the right kind of scare,
that's a reasonable scare.

  
You know, I get scared for things
that don't make sense at all, like...

  
Clowns, with red noses, or like
the rag that use to wipe on table.

when you finishes eating,
like a.. chain restaurant.

Look, the point is I'm here for you, okay?

  
And as long as you're by my side,
I'm not leaving this apartment.

No, of course, of course.

Set aside the feverish homeless cannibal
I'm living in the dream.

I've had always my whole life
wanted to brush a girl's hair over her ear.

Goodnight

Oh my god.

Are you okay?

Woah woah woah

Okay okay okay.
Stop stop stop.

What're you doing?

Look, stay back 406, okay?
I dont wanna hurt you, but..

Shit.

Oh my god.
I'm so fucking sorry.

You see, you just can't trust anyone.

The first girl I let into my life
and she tries to eat me.

Please, listen to me
406, if you're in there
You're just sick, okay?

That was my first brush,
with the plaque of the 21st century.

Remember mad cow disease? Well 'Mad cow'
became 'mad person' became 'mad zombie'.

It's a fast acting virus, that left you with a swollen
brain, raging fever and made you hateful, violent.

And give you really really bad
case of the munchies

Okay.

I've heard there's a place untouched by all this crap?

Yeah, you heard the same thing?

There are no penguins
on the north pole.

Wait, the last time I laid some pipe?

It's personal.

Wallpapered the closet, passed the gravy.

Oh, oh. Made love.

Uhm.. Three weeks ago, yeah.
In the back of an abandoned FedEx truck.

No, no, I was headed east..

She uh, west.

And we took shelter in the back of the truck.
It was full of undelivered packages.

Beverly.
Beverly Hills.

So uh, what about you?

Oh my god.
It mades you sick.

You know, it makes you sad,
it makes you...

makes you think you could go back
To the way things were right now,
you know, you'd be...

You'd be out in the backyard,
you know, trying to catch a fireflies.

...and instead of this.

I mean it makes you...

I'm worried about you.

Tallahassee had a sick sense of humor
when it came to zombies.

Zombies aren't the most loveable creature
but he really hated them.

In fact the only thing he was more obsessed
with than killing a zombie was finding a Twinkie.

Something about the Twinkie reminded
him about, time not so long ago.

When things were simple
and not so fucking psychotic.

It was like if he got a taste of
that comforting childhood treat,

the world would become innocent again
and everything would return to normall.

What, are you prospecting?

Jesus christ.
You're a dangerous man.

You're gonna risk our lives
for a Twinkie?

When Tallahassee goes Hulk on a zombie,
he set the standard for not to be fucked with.

No fear,
nothing to lose.

What can I say, it's like,
it's like art.

Don't swing,
don't swing.

  
Swing.

Thank you.

You're incredible.

And they're so fat.

Uh, I think we should
probably just keep going.

All I could think of was
"What are the odds?".

Another marriageable women to
bring home to the folks.

Someone's ear is in danger
of having hair brushed over it.

Hey
I'll catch up

"Rule Twenty-two: When in Doubt,
Know Your Way Out"

Oh, no no no no, he did.

I'm just kind of like a
Sancho Panza character.

Look
Um, I don't think she has long.

No no no no, she's just a little girl.

Alright, I'm sorry. Look, I know,
you know that you're really sick.

But uh, your sister wants me to..

Oh look, we don't know
that there's definitely no cure right?

Woah.. Wait, why are
you guys doing this?

Of course the first hot girl in a thousand miles shows up,
makes me feels like an idiot, steals my double-barrel
  
and then says I'm the one that can't be trusted.

You're the one that gave her the gun.

So he's on one of the serious Tour 'de France
bikes, you know with the, like the toeholds, right

And uh, he's peddling. And the zombie's
head is like caught in the gear.

Can't a guy take a dumper in peace?

Uh, what are you looking for?

Well, listen,
I'll find your ring
and I'll FedEx it to you.

Ha-ha. Don't be silly.

Just-- Just give me your number.

Yeah. I'll find it.

Yeah, I'll start
looking for it right now,
because I got nothing
else to do.

I was engaged once,
but I'm single now.

Bye-bye.

Hope you make your flight.

No, but I know it's around here somewhere.

She's on a plane,
that's the beauty of it.

Let me call you back.

Hey, you found my ring.

Thanks. I've been looking
all over for it.

Well, it's my friend's.

I'm gonna send it to her.

Fourty, sixty, eighty, four-hundred.

That's it.

That's the whole register.

You made someone very happy.

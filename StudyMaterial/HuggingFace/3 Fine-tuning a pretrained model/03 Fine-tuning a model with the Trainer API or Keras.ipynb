    "ðŸ¤— Transformers provides a Trainer class to help you fine-tune any of the pretrained models it provides on your dataset. Once you've done all the data preprocessing work onin the last section, you have just a few steps left to define the Trainer. The hardest part is likely to be preparing the environment to run Trainer.train(), as it will run very slowly on a CPU. If you don't a GPU set up, you can get access to free GPUs or TPUs on Google Colab.\n",

The only argument you have to provide is a directtory where the trained model will be saved, as well as the checkpoints along the way. For all the rest, you can leave the defaults, which should work pretty well for a basic fine-tuning."

    "You will notice that unlike in Chapter 2, you get a warning after instantiating this pretrained model. This is because BERT has not been pretrained on classifying pairs of sentences, so the head of the pretrained model has been discarded and a new head suitable for sequence classification has been added instead. The warnings indicate that some weights were not used (the ones corresponding to the dropped pretraining head) and that some others were randomly initialized (the ones for the new head). It concludes by encouraging you to train the model, which is exactly what we are going to do now.\n",

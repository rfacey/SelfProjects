    "# Exercise - Discover floating-point types\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll work with floating-point data types to learn about the nuanced differences between each data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A floating point is a simple value type that represents numbers to the right of the decimal place. Unlike integral numbers, there are other considerations beyond the maximum and minimum values you can store in a given floating-point type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluate floating-types\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you must consider the digits of precision each type allows. Precision is the number of value places stored after the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you must consider the manner in which the values are stored and the impact on the accuracy of tha value. For example, float and double values are stored internally in a binary (base 2) format, while decimal is stored in a decimal (base 10) format. Why does this matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing math on binary floating-point values can produce results that may surprise you if you're used to decimal (base 10) math. Often, binary floating-point math is an approximation of the real value. Therefore, float and double are useful because large numbers can be stored using a small memory footprint. However, float and double should only be used when an approximation is useful. For example, being a few thousandths off when calculating the splatter of a snowball in a video game is close enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need a more precise answer, you should use decimal. Each value of type decimal has a relatively large memory footprint, however performing math operations give you a more precise result. So, you should use decimal when working with financial data or any scenario where you need an accurate result from a calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use the MinValue and MaxValue\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Delete or use the line comment operator // to comment out all of the code from the previous exercises.\n",
    "2. To see the value ranges from the various data types, update your code in the Visual Studio Editor as follows:"

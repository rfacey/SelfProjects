Ow, I'm on fire!

Ouch!

The hell I am.

Oh, I do it to blend in.

You know.

Zombies don't mess with other zombies.

Buddy of mine, makeup guy, showed me how to do this.

Cornstarch. You know, some berries, little licorice for the ladies.

Suits my lifestyle, you know. I like to get out and do stuff.

Just played nine holes on the Riviera.

Just walked on. Nobody there.

Well, that's why we do it.

You are staring at me. It's a hairpiece. A piece.

I just saw Eddie Van Halen.

At the Hollywood Bowl.

He's a zombie.

So, uh, how about a little West Coast hospitality?

Can I--? Wha--? Can I get you something?

What would you--?

What would you like?

Smooth, isn't it?

See you on the other side, Pete.

Don't cross the streams!

Don't cross the streams!

So Columbus is the scared one?

I'll get him.

Watch this.

Is that how you say hello where you come from?

I'm just Bill, I think, now.

Yeah?

Ah. That's still tender.

No.

It was my bad.

I was never a very good practical joker.

Garfield, maybe.

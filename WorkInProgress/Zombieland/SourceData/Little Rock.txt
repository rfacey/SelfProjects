So, you did all this for a Twinkie?

Don't talk about me like I'm not here.

It's not her decision

It's mine.

I made her promise

We already said goodbye,
but we didn't have a gun.

You're just gutless.

Give him the gun.

I love you too.

And if you got it,
sugarless gum.

Relax okay, I just passed for a zombie.

What I'd give for a shower...

So, do you think it's true?

You know, about Pacific Playland?

Just me.

Twelve's the new twenty.
Gun, please.

All those violent video games.

Thank you.

Now, honk your horn.

Honk it.

Your ring?

Do I get a reward?

You too.

Let me see.

Hm. Enough for us
to get to California.

Someday, I want a ring this big.

No--

Pacific Playland.

Yeah. We went there as kids.

Well, did you guys hear?
There are no zombies there.

No.

Yeah, no, I don't.

It's like the first time that I've ever driven.

Yeah, but no. she's not. She's not. She's only famous when she's Hannah Montana, when she's wearing the wig.

So...

Who?

Wait. Who's Bill Murray?

Who's Gandhi?

No Twinkies.

He has his own movie theater?

Whoa.

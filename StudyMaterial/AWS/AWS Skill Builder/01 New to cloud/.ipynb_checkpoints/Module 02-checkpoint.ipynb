    "# Module 2 introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the benefits of Amazon EC2 at a basic level\n",
    "- Identify the different Amazon EC2 instance types\n",
    "- Differentiate between the various billing options for Amazon EC2\n",
    "- Summarize the benefits of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\n",
    "- Summarize the benefits of Elastic Load Balancing\n",
    "- Give an example of the uses for Elastic Load Balancing\n",
    "- Summarize the differences between Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)\n",
    "- Summarize additional AWS compute options\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are responsible for the architecture of your company's resources and need to suport new websites. With traditional on-premise resources, you have to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spend money upfront to purchase hardware.\n",
    "- Wait for the servers to be delivered to you.\n",
    "- Install the servers in your physical data center.\n",
    "- Make all the necessary configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparison, with an Amazon EC2 instance you can use a virtual server to run applications in the AWS Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can provision and launch an Amazon EC2 instance within minutes.\n",
    "- You can stop using it when you have finished running a workload.\n",
    "- You pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated.\n",
    "- You can save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Amazon EC2 works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launch\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you launch an instance. Begin by selecting a template with basic configurations for your instance. These configurations include the operating system, application server, or applications. You also select the instance type, which is the specific hardware configurations of your instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are preparing to launch an instance, you specify security settings to control the network traffic that can flow into and out of your instance. Later in this course, we will explore Amazon EC2 security features in greater detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connect\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, connect to the instance. You can connect to the instance in several ways. Your programs and applications have multiple different methods to connect directly to the instance and exchange data. Users can also connect to the instance by logging in and accessing the computer desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have connected to the instance, you can begin using it. You can run commands to install software, add storage, copy and organize files, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amazon EC2 instance types\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon EC2 instance types are optimized for different tasks. When selecting an instance type, consider the specific needs of your workloads and applications. This might include requirements for compute, memory, or storage capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General purpose instances\n",
    "\n",
    "**General purpose instances** provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. You can use them for a variety of workloads, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- application servers\n",
    "- gaming servers\n",
    "- backend servers for enterprise applications\n",
    "- small and medium databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you ahve an application in which the resource needs for sompute, memory, and networking are roughly equivalent. You might consider running it on a general purpose instance because the application does not require optimization in any single resource area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compute optimized instances\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compute optimized instances** are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors. Like general purpose instances, you can use compute optimized instances for workloads such as web, application, and gaming servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the difference is compute optimized applications are ideal for high-performances web servers, compute-intensive applications servers, and dedicated gaming servers. You can also use compute optimized instances for batch processing workloads that require processing many transactions in a single group.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory optimzed instances\n",
    "\n"

So, you did all this for a Twinkie?

Don't talk about me like I'm not here.

It's not her decision

It's mine.

I made her promise

We already said goodbye,
but we didn't have a gun.

You're just gutless.

Give him the gun.

I love you too.

And if you got it,
sugarless gum.

Relax okay, I just passed for a zombie.

What I'd give for a shower...

So, do you think it's true?

You know, about Pacific Playland?

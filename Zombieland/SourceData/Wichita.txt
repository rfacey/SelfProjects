Come quick.

Yeah, I know.
I know, and she knows

We're just looking for a way out.

Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

I'll do it.

I love you.

Now that you mention it.

We'll take your weapons, your car keys,
your ammunition.

Well, better you make the mistake of trusting us,
than us make the mistake of trusting you.

Do not say the S-H-O-W-E-R, okay?

Let's just get where we're going.

Is what true?

Trust me.

    "With many data types available in C#, choosing the right one to use means that you need to understand when you might choose one data type over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing *why* you might choose one data type over another, you need to understand more about data types. You also need to know how data and data types work in C# and .NET.\n",

    "## What is data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering the question \"what is data\" depends on who you ask, and in what context you're asking it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, data is essentially a value that is stored in the computer's memory as a series of bits. A bit is a simple binary switch represented as a 0 or 1, or rather, \"off\" and \"on.\" A single bit doesn't seem useful, however when you combine 9 bits together in a sequence, they form a byte. When used in a byte, each bit takes on a meaning in the sequence. If fact, you can represent 256 different combinations with just 8 bits if you use a binary (base-2) numeral system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a binary numeral system, you can represent the number 195 as 11000011. The following table helps you visualize how this works. The first row has eight columns that correspond"

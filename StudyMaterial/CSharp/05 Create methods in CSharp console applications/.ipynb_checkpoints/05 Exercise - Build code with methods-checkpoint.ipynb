    "# Exercise - Build code with methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are useful for organizing code, reusing code, and for tackling problems efficiently. You can think of a method like a black box that takes input, performs the named task, and returns output. With this assumption, you can quickly structure programs just by naming your tasks as methods, and then filling in the logic after you've identified all of the necessary tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use plain language to describe steps in code, without strictly adhering to syntax rules, you're using \"pseudo-code\". Combining methods and pseudo-code is a great way to quickly power through any challenging programming task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use methods to structure code\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're a candidate in a coding interview. The interviewer wants you to write a program that checks whether an IPv4 address is valid or invalid. You're given the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A valid IPv4 address consists of four numbers separated by dots\n",
    "- Each number must not contain leading zeroes\n",
    "- Each number must range from 0 to 255\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.1.1 and 255.255.255.255 are examples of valid IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPv4 address is provided as a string. You can assume that it only consists of digits and dots (there are no letters in the string provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you approach this task?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Break down the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you'll identify the steps needed to solve the problem. If you look closely at the rules, you might realize that it only tasks three steps to determine whether or not an IPv4 address is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Visual Studio Editor, delete any existing code from the previous exercises.\n",
    "2. Enter the following pseudo-code into the Editor:"
